Q1. What is the use of Gitignore File in React Application?

Ans1. The .gitignore file in a React application (or any software project) is used to
 specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. When you're working on a 
 project, there are often files or directories that you don't want to include in version
 control because they are specific to your local development environment, build outputs, 
 or contain sensitive information.
